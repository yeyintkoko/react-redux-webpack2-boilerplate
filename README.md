# React and Redux, Webpack 2 boilerplate

## This is a fork for react-redux-webpack2-boilerplate from Stanko and updated all dependencies to latest versions of current (April 11, 2017). So be careful with react router which is in 4.0.0 (current latest version) and it is a change from 3.x. Read doc from https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic.

## What is this?

Boilerplate I extracted from a small real world project.

~~Webpack 2 is still in beta, but at this point is the only version
that I managed to run everything I wanted, including hot module replacement.~~

This boilerplate includes complete, minimal react app.
By complete I mean it has examples for:

- components (both container/views and regular ones)
- routes
- reducers (redux)
- actions (both sync and async),
- SASS (with autoprefixer)<sup>1</sup>
- dummy API
- using assets (in CSS and components)
- imports relative to the app root

<sup>1</sup> Using source maps breaks urls in the CSS loader - https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/232. Try [this](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader/issues/232#issuecomment-240449998) to fix it (but it breaks testing from local network).

## Setup

Tested with node 6.x and 7.x

```
$ npm install
```

## Running in dev mode

```
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/` from your browser of choice.
Server is visible from the local network as well.

![Running in the iTerm2](http://i.imgur.com/IxamMBh.png)

It is using [webpack dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard), so please note the following:

**OS X Terminal.app users:** Make sure that **View â†’ Allow Mouse Reporting** is enabled, otherwise scrolling through logs and modules won't work. If your version of Terminal.app doesn't have this feature, you may want to check out an alternative such as [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/).

## Build (production)

Build will be placed in the `build` folder.

```
$ npm run build
```

If your app is not running on the server root you should change `publicPath` at two places.

In `webpack.config.js` (ATM line 147):

```
output: {
  path: buildPath,
  publicPath: '/your-app/',
  filename: 'app-[hash].js',
},
```

and in `source/js/routes` (ATM line 9):

```
const publicPath = '/your-app/';
```

Don't forget the trailing slash (`/`). In development visit `http://localhost:3000/your-app/`.

## Running in preview production mode

This command will start webpack dev server, but with `NODE_ENV` set to `production`.
Everything will be minified and served.
Hot reload will not work, so you need to refresh the page manually after changing the code.

```
npm run preview
```

## Linting

For linting I'm using [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb),
but some options are overridden to my personal preferences.

```
$ npm run lint
```

## Git hooks

Linting pre-push hook is not enabled by default.
It will prevent the push if lint task fails,
but you need to add it manually by running:

```
npm run hook-add
```

To remove it, run this task:

```
npm run hook-remove
```
